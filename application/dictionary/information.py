    'all_centrality' : 'Centrality is a concept that is widely used in network analysis to measure the importance of individual nodes (or vertices) in a network. It is a way of quantifying the "centrality" or "importance" of a node in a network by taking into account its relationships with other nodes.',
    'centrality_degree' : 'This is the simplest measure of centrality and is based on the number of edges (connections) a node has. In directed networks, degree centrality can be divided into in-degree (number of incoming edges) and out-degree (number of outgoing edges) centralities. Nodes with higher degree centrality are considered more important.',
    'centrality_eigenvector' : 'This measure takes into account not only the number of connections a node has but also the quality of those connections. Nodes with high eigenvector centrality are connected to other well-connected nodes, and therefore, they have a higher influence within the network.',
    'centrality_closeness' : 'This measure calculates the average shortest path length between a node and all other nodes in the network. Nodes with lower average shortest path lengths have higher closeness centrality, indicating that they can reach other nodes more quickly, making them more central in the network.',
    'centrality_betwenness' : 'Betweenness centrality quantifies the number of times a node acts as a bridge along the shortest path between two other nodes. Nodes with higher betweenness centrality are critical for maintaining connectivity within the network and can control the flow of information or resources.',
    'centrality_load' : 'Load centrality is a measure in network analysis that quantifies the importance of a node based on the amount of flow (e.g., information or resources) it handles within a network. It is closely related to betweenness centrality',
